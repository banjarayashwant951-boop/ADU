# Atmospheric Distillation Simulation (Aspen Plus)

## 📌 Project Overview
This self-project focuses on the simulation of an **atmospheric crude oil distillation column** using **Aspen Plus**. The objective is to model the separation of crude oil into different product cuts and analyze column performance under varying operating conditions.

## 🛠️ Tools & Software
- **Aspen Plus**
- Property estimation and thermodynamic modeling
- Process simulation and analysis

## ⚙️ Methodology
1. **Feed Characterization**
   - Defined crude oil properties using appropriate assay data
   - Selected suitable thermodynamic property methods for hydrocarbon systems

2. **Column Configuration**
   - Modeled an atmospheric distillation column
   - Specified number of stages, feed stage, condenser, and reboiler conditions
   - Defined product draw-off locations

3. **Simulation & Analysis**
   - Performed steady-state simulation
   - Evaluated temperature and composition profiles across the column
   - Analyzed product cuts (light ends, naphtha, kerosene, gas oil, residue)

## 📊 Key Results
- Generated realistic **temperature profiles** along column stages  
- Obtained **product compositions** consistent with industrial atmospheric distillation behavior  
- Studied the effect of **operating parameters** (reflux ratio, feed temperature, pressure) on separation efficiency  

## 📈 Key Learnings
- Understanding of crude oil characterization in Aspen Plus  
- Insight into vapor–liquid equilibrium behavior in multicomponent systems  
- Practical exposure to column design and performance evaluation
